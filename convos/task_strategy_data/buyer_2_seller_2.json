It\u2019s great to know that it aligns with my requirement for third-row seating, and I am definitely interested in exploring this model further. However, I must emphasize that having specific pricing and discount details upfront is essential for me before making the trip to your dealership. \n\nIf the CX-9 is available, could you please provide me with its starting price? Additionally, if you could share an estimate of the discounts typically offered on this model, that would significantly help me in my evaluation process. I want to ensure that I can stay within my budget of $70,000 without any surprises.\n\nIf you can get me that information, I\u2019d be more than happy to discuss setting a time to come in for a test drive. It\u2019s important for me to know that I\u2019m considering options that are feasible within my financial constraints. Thank you for understanding!"

Typically, when considering the final price, you should be aware of:\n\n1. **Sales Tax**: This varies by state but generally ranges from 5% to 9% of the purchase price.\n2. **Registration Fees**: These are usually determined by your state and can vary.\n3. **Dealer Fees**: This may include documentation fees or other dealership-related costs, typically ranging from $200 to $500 but can differ by dealership.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, we can estimate the final price.

Typically, when considering the final price, you should be aware of:\n\n1. **Sales Tax**: This varies by state but generally ranges from 5% to 9% of the purchase price.\n2. **Registration Fees**: These are usually determined by your state and can vary.\n3. **Dealer Fees**: This may include documentation fees or other dealership-related costs, typically ranging from $200 to $500 but can differ by dealership.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, we can estimate the final price.

Your consideration of the Mazda CX-9 is definitely a strong choice.\n\nTo give you a ballpark estimate, the starting price for a base model of the Mazda CX-9 typically falls around the $40,000 to $45,000 range, depending on the trim you choose. This means that with an average discount of 5% to 10%, we could be looking at a reduction of about $2,000 to $4,500 off the MSRP, which would bring the final price into the range of $35,500 to $42,000. \n\nGiven that room, I believe the CX-9, even with higher trims or additional options, can be a great fit within your budget when discounts are considered. \n\nI'm confident that we can find a combination that works well for you. If you feel comfortable with this estimate, I\u2019d love to schedule a visit so we can explore the options in person. Just let me know what time works best for you!"

That\u2019s a pretty competitive price for that model, especially considering those features.\n\nBuyer: It's still above my intended budget of $35,000.

However, any Mazda in that price range typically aligns closely with vehicles that might have the features you're looking for.\n\nNow, regarding additional fees, it's always prudent to consider a few other factors. You might encounter taxes, registration fees, and a possible documentation fee, which could add a little to your final cost. Typically, though, these additional costs are manageable and wouldn\u2019t dramatically shift your budget.\n\nIf we land on that $70,000 final price with the discount, that would keep you in a really solid position.
