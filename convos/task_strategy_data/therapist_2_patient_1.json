This can help slow your heart rate and clear your mind.\n   \n2. **Grounding Exercises**: Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique\u2014identify 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. This redirects your focus away from anxiety.\n\n3. **Positive Affirmations**: Write down a few affirmations that resonate with you, such as \"I am capable\" or \"I can handle this.\" When feeling anxious, reading these can shift your mindset.\n\n4. **Short Walks**: If you're feeling particularly anxious, stepping outside for a quick walk can help clear your mind and reduce tension.\n\n5. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Focus on tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups, which can relieve physical tension associated with anxiety.\n\nWould any of these techniques feel manageable for you to start incorporating into your checklist?
