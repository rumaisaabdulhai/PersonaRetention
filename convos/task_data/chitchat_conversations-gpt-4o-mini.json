The way it intertwines the horror of the events with the determination of those trying to stop him is really compelling.

I\u2019d also add \"Beloved\" by Toni Morrison\u2014it\u2019s a haunting exploration of memory, trauma, and the legacy of slavery that resonates on so many levels.

He has a talent for blending the mundane with the extraordinary, which makes the fantastical elements feel all the more real and relatable. His ability to evoke emotion through simple yet powerful imagery also adds depth to the narrative. In \"Neverwhere,\" for example, the underground world feels alive and gritty, while in \"The Ocean at the End of the Lane,\" there's a nostalgic and eerie vibe that lingers long after you finish reading.
