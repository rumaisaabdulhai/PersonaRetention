With a cash rebate of around $1,500 currently available, we can reduce that price to $28,500.\n\nAssuming an interest rate of about 3.5% for a 60-month term, your monthly payments would be roughly around $500. However, if we adjust the loan term to 72 months, your payments would drop to about $425 per month, keeping everything within your budget!\n\nAdditionally, if you're comfortable reducing the trim level or considering a pre-owned option, we might be able to find an even better monthly payment without compromising too much on features.\n\nHow does that sound to you?

It really is a fantastic choice, especially with its blend of space, technology, and safety features.\n\nFor financing, a common recommendation is to aim for a down payment of around 20% of the vehicle's price. For this certified pre-owned Honda CR-V, if we estimate the price at around $25,000, a down payment of $5,000 would help keep your monthly payments manageable. However, any amount you can put down will lower your monthly payments and the overall interest you'll pay.\n\nCurrently, we have some attractive financing options for certified pre-owned vehicles. If you have good credit, we might be able to offer interest rates as low as 3.5% to 4.5% for terms ranging from 36 to 60 months. \n\nTo illustrate this:\n- With a $5,000 down payment on a $25,000 price, you'd be financing $20,000.\n- At a 4% interest rate for 60 months, your monthly payment would be approximately $370. \n\nOf course, these numbers can fluctuate based on your final down payment, the interest rate you qualify for, and any promotions we might have. \n\nWould you like me to crunch some numbers together based on your ideal down payment to see what your options look like?"

Let me clarify those important details for you:\n\n### 1. Deductibles:\nMost comprehensive extended warranties do have a deductible associated with them. Typically, you can choose from different deductible amounts when you purchase the warranty, such as $100, $250, or $500. This means that for each repair, you would pay your chosen deductible amount, and the warranty will cover the rest. The lower the deductible, the higher the warranty cost, so it\u2019s important to choose what works best for your budget.\n\n### 2. Warranty Use Process:\nIf you need to use the warranty, here's how it generally works:\n- **Authorized Repair Facilities**: You can take your vehicle to any authorized repair facility, not just our dealership. This gives you flexibility in choosing where to get your repairs done.\n- **Claim Process**: Before any work begins, it's a good practice to call the warranty provider to confirm coverage and obtain authorization for the repair. The shop will often handle this process for you, so you don't have to worry about it.\n- **Payment**: After the repair is completed, you would pay your deductible at the repair facility, and the warranty company covers the rest directly with the shop.\n\n### Moving Forward:\nWith that information, do you feel ready to proceed with the purchase? If so, we can start getting the paperwork ready so you can secure your new Honda CR-V along with the comprehensive warranty. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"

For this certified pre-owned Honda CR-V, if we estimate the price at around $25,000, a down payment of $5,000 would help keep your monthly payments manageable.

Let me clarify those important details for you:\n\n### 1. Deductibles:\nMost comprehensive extended warranties do have a deductible associated with them. Typically, you can choose from different deductible amounts when you purchase the warranty, such as $100, $250, or $500. This means that for each repair, you would pay your chosen deductible amount, and the warranty will cover the rest. The lower the deductible, the higher the warranty cost, so it\u2019s important to choose what works best for your budget.\n\n### 2. Warranty Use Process:\nIf you need to use the warranty, here's how it generally works:\n- **Authorized Repair Facilities**: You can take your vehicle to any authorized repair facility, not just our dealership. This gives you flexibility in choosing where to get your repairs done.\n- **Claim Process**: Before any work begins, it's a good practice to call the warranty provider to confirm coverage and obtain authorization for the repair. The shop will often handle this process for you, so you don't have to worry about it.\n- **Payment**: After the repair is completed, you would pay your deductible at the repair facility, and the warranty company covers the rest directly with the shop.\n\n### Moving Forward:\nWith that information, do you feel ready to proceed with the purchase? If so, we can start getting the paperwork ready so you can secure your new Honda CR-V along with the comprehensive warranty. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"
