            "message": "1. MA: I still see that there are few marks on the leather seats. How was it that it got those marks? 2. Seller: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry. I really didn\u2019t notice that, but I will clean the leather seats for you before I deliver the car. 3. Bought the car Once again natural spoken turns were classified using AAM Consultants\u2019 dialogue coding scheme. The aim of calculating the ASR scores was not a classification short of the utterances, rather it was to capture the composite nature of entire dialogue and this was associated with occurrences of LLM\u2019s (Turn Modes). Table 2 suggests that in majority of the cases, LLM-6 (\u201cOffer\u201d) is associated with Ultimate Request: \u201cI\u2019d like to see about getting a new car\u201d. Similarly, LLM-2 (\u201cDeclare\u201d), LLM-1 (\u201cExplain\u201d), LLM-5 (\u201cPromise\u201d) show their direct associations with same Turn Mode. LLM-4 (\u201cQuestion\u201d) seems like an independent Turn Mode although it shows some association with LLM-1. With more than a half topics of negotiation showing the combined occurrence of more than two Turn Modes and that too of different types, ASR examinations validate the message that when listening to a dialogue thread, humans also have an idea of combined Turn Modes. With this idea, it is expected that the extracted conversation features would have higher explanatory powers on negotiation outcomes."
