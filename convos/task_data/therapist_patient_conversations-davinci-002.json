When the patient gets to the end of the hall, they are presented with a number of options, which will only be visible to the player, such as \u2018Mum\u2019, \u2018Child\u2019, \u2018Panic, leave\u2019, and \u2018Suicidal\u2019. Austin described how he wanted a final decision to be made before being able to exit, to prevent the bandit exception to what is \u2018allowed\u2019.
