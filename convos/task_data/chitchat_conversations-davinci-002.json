An enumeration is introduced at the place of which we want to know how often to converse. The answer has form before<conversationId>. The \u201ceach\u201d stipulation is required either by the OS discussing or a clause requesting the UAA. Each conversation gets a unique number. The \u201cbetween\u201d clause requests the UAA to cancel the enumeration when conversationId is equal. When we begin looking at the interaction, conversationId = 1, so the enumerate clause acts on (conversationId = 1) and beginning enumeration where =generatednr<conversationId>. The generatednr clause acts on conversationId and terminates conversationId when equals conversationId. The while clause is mandatory. Each conversation is ennumarated. While conversationId is bounded, the enumerate clause keeps generating conversations. Each conversation (in turn) records the self contained numbers in the computer. These numbers (along with the self contained naming prefix \u201c3\u201d) are bound twice with accumulator where clause. This is where the conversation ends (as if we said conversationId equals conversationId. The number of conversations is bound by the answer to the WHILE currying clause and accumulated in the accumulatorResponder. The while not clause serves as the conversation ender."
