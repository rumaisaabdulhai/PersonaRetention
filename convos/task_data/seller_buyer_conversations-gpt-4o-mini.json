I\u2019m particularly interested in the safety features and the tech inside, so it sounds like both models fit my needs. Comparing the two, the Civic seems to have a slight edge in space and interior comfort, which is a plus for longer drives.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d like to see how they feel on the road. Yes, I\u2019d love to schedule a test drive for both the Corolla and the Civic. When would be a good time to come in? Also, do you have any promotions or deals currently available?"

If you\u2019re considering a longer term, we also have options available for up to 72 months, though interest rates may vary.\n\n3. **Final Pricing of the CR-V:** The base price for the model you drove is around $28,000. After applying the $1,500 rebate, that brings the price down to about $26,500. \n\n   - **Taxes and Fees:** Depending on your location, sales tax could be around 7-9%. Let's say it\u2019s 8% for calculation purposes, which would add about $2,120 in taxes. Additionally, there might be a dealer documentation fee (typically around $500) and any registration costs.\n\n   - **Estimated Total Cost:** Combining those numbers:\n     - Base Price After Rebate: $26,500\n     - Estimated Taxes: $2,120\n     - Dealer Fees: $500\n     - **Total Estimated Cost:** Approximately $29,120\n\nThis is just an estimate, so once we finalize details, I can give you the exact total. \n\nWith these rates and promotions, would you like to apply for financing today or explore any specific loan options before making a decision?

This is available if you finance through Honda Financial Services, which can also unlock competitive interest rates.\n\n2. **Financing Rates:** Our current financing rates start as low as 2.9% for well-qualified buyers for up to 60 months. If you\u2019re considering a longer term, we also have options available for up to 72 months, though interest rates may vary.\n\n3. **Final Pricing of the CR-V:** The base price for the model you drove is around $28,000. After applying the $1,500 rebate, that brings the price down to about $26,500. \n\n   - **Taxes and Fees:** Depending on your location, sales tax could be around 7-9%. Let's say it\u2019s 8% for calculation purposes, which would add about $2,120 in taxes. Additionally, there might be a dealer documentation fee (typically around $500) and any registration costs.\n\n   - **Estimated Total Cost:** Combining those numbers:\n     - Base Price After Rebate: $26,500\n     - Estimated Taxes: $2,120\n     - Dealer Fees: $500\n     - **Total Estimated Cost:** Approximately $29,120\n\nThis is just an estimate, so once we finalize details, I can give you the exact total. \n\nWith these rates and promotions, would you like to apply for financing today or explore any specific loan options before making a decision?
