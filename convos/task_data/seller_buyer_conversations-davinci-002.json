The lease on the Fusion (let's say the Fusion Hybrid SE) is $299/month for 36 months with $2,699 due at signing. The Fusion Titanium FWD is $439/month for 36 months with $3,469 due at signing. The Hyundai Sonata is $249/month for 39 months with $3,379 due at signing. Looking at these numbers, I prefer the Sonata which is month for month, similar value to the Fusion Titanium. When looking at leases for competing cars as well as dealer offer pull options, it seems the mouths are the rough equivalent for comparable cars and I am not comparing every single option but the Sonata was up, then down a little, then up, then up, so somewhere in there, it's all relative. I woiuld like to add, when you have a brand new car, you can easily stretch the service interval to under the recommended 3000 miles at least 1500-2000 miles. This is why I like the lawsuit studies on tires to find consumer information on car tires and how long the ratings generated by the group (say, the Tire Rack) last on the road. These times vary so much that it's better to start from 45000+ miles. Anyway, you were asking about what I like about the Hyundai Sonata and why I like putting my current car into service. I can give you a complete breakdown, but if we add the numbers up, lease on 2013 Coupe SE is $199/month, FWD Sonata is $249/ month. If I financed either car for 60 months at say, 4.99%, the Sonata would be $342/month based on a value of about $21,634. The Coupe for the same exact loan would be $341/month based on a value of $18,663. The difference between the 36 month lease with $4,999 due at signing for the price, 0.99% APR, for the first three years, is that I do not pay that much that comes off the loan total, in the first three years I pay interest on the loan and principal only. This creates a margin by which the collective few fees and the sales tax of every 600-700 dollars is worth of products added. You can use these two figures (lease payment and cash financed payment) from today, the total interest paid"
