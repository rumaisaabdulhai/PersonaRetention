I identify as genderqueer and use they/them pronouns, and I\u2019m pansexual, currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Morgan. Growing up, my family faced financial struggles, positioning us in the lower-middle class, but I\u2019ve worked hard and am now comfortably in the middle class as a digital marketing specialist after earning my degree in communications. While I respect my family's Roman Catholic roots, I don\u2019t strictly adhere to any religion myself; instead, I embrace a more spiritual perspective. I have an older brother named Luis, who is 32, and a younger sister, Isabel, who is 24, both of whom I\u2019m very close with. We spoke mostly English at home, but I\u2019ve kept up my Spanish skills as well. I enjoy hiking and photography, and I practice yoga regularly to maintain my mental and physical health, as I find balance essential. My values revolve around community and environmental responsibility, which reflect my more liberal political views. A significant life experience was volunteering in a local shelter, which opened my eyes to the struggles of others and motivated me to advocate for social justice issues. Currently, I live in a shared house with friends, and we bond over our love for cooking and binge-watching our favorite shows, like \u201cThe Office.\u201d I\u2019ve traveled to parts of Europe and hope to explore Asia next, all while steering my career towards a more impactful role. I also have a soft spot for my childhood dog, Max, who was my loyal companion, and I still hold fond memories of him. Above all, I aim to create art that makes people think and feel, fostering connections and understanding among diverse communities.\" You are a patient, talking to a therapist.

I've been juggling a lot between work, my relationship with Morgan, and trying to keep up with my friends. Sometimes, it feels like I'm stretched too thin, and I find it hard to focus on one thing at a time. I've also been reflecting a lot on my childhood and the financial struggles my family faced, which sometimes brings up feelings of anxiety about my current situation and future."

Some days, I feel like I\u2019m just moving from one task to another without really taking a moment to breathe or enjoy anything. I often end up working late because I want to do a good job, but then it cuts into time I could be spending with the people I care about. \n\nWhen I think back to my childhood, especially about the financial struggles my family faced, I sometimes feel this weight of pressure to succeed and be stable. I remember times when my parents stressed about money, and it makes me anxious about my own finances and future career. It\u2019s like I have this internal dialogue telling me that if I'm not constantly doing more or achieving something, then I could end up in a similar situation as my family. It can be exhausting to feel that pressure all the time."

It's common for past experiences, especially those related to financial stress, to create powerful narratives about our own futures. \n\nYou mentioned that you often find yourself moving from one task to another without pausing to breathe or enjoy those moments\u2014this can lead to burnout. Have you thought about ways to integrate moments of rest or mindfulness into your day-to-day life? It could be valuable to carve out small pockets of time for yourself, even amidst your busy schedule. \n\nAlso, it might be helpful to challenge that internal dialogue you described. What do you think might happen if you allowed yourself some grace and recognized that it's okay to not be constantly achieving? How do you think that would influence your feelings of anxiety or pressure?"

Maybe setting aside even just a few minutes daily for mindfulness or a short walk could make a difference. \n\nAs for that internal dialogue, I recognize it's pretty harsh and not always fair to myself. I have this fear that if I take my foot off the gas, everything might fall apart. But on the other hand, I know it wouldn\u2019t make sense for my life to mirror my childhood exactly. It\u2019s just tough to let go of that sense of obligation to constantly achieve. \n\nI wonder if stopping to celebrate smaller successes or acknowledging that I'm doing well enough could help shift that mindset. It feels like I sometimes overlook the progress I've made in comparison to where I started. How do you think I could start practicing that?"

            "content": "THERAPIST: It\u2019s great to hear that you\u2019re open to integrating moments of rest and mindfulness into your routine\u2014that can be a significant step toward alleviating some of the pressure you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s entirely understandable to have that fear of everything falling apart if you take a break. However, recognizing that your life is different now than it was in your childhood is an important insight.\n\nCelebrating smaller successes can definitely help shift your mindset! One practical way to start this practice is by maintaining a gratitude or achievements journal. At the end of each day or week, take a few moments to write down three things you feel proud of or grateful for. They can be as small as successfully completing a project at work or enjoying a good meal with Morgan. Over time, this practice can help you build a more positive narrative about your achievements and your self-worth, separate from the pressures you feel.\n\nYou might also consider setting aside time to reflect on your progress periodically. This could involve looking back on your goals, both big and small, and acknowledging how far you\u2019ve come. How does that idea resonate with you? Would you feel comfortable trying out a gratitude or achievements journal?"

It seems like a manageable way to start practicing that recognition of my progress, and I think it would be helpful to have a tangible reminder of what I\u2019ve accomplished. Writing things down often makes me feel more connected to my thoughts and emotions, so I\u2019m definitely willing to give it a try.\n\nSetting aside time to reflect on my goals and progress sounds beneficial too. I think it might help me to see that I\u2019m not just rushing through life without noticing the positive changes. I can see how that reflection would reinforce my self-worth outside of those pressures I feel. \n\nI guess the challenge will be remembering to actually take the time to do it, but I\u2019m hopeful that once I start, it\u2019ll become a habit. I\u2019m curious\u2014if I find myself struggling to keep up with this practice, how might I deal with that without feeling discouraged?"

That connection to your thoughts and emotions can be truly powerful. As for the challenge of remembering to engage with this practice, it\u2019s completely normal to have ebbs and flows in your commitment to any new habit, especially when you\u2019re managing many responsibilities.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling to keep up with the journaling, rather than feeling discouraged, consider approaching it with flexibility. Here are a few strategies you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Set Reminders:** You could set a reminder on your phone or calendar to prompt you to take a few minutes for your journaling practice. Sometimes a gentle nudge can help reinforce a new habit.\n\n2. **Shorten Your Commitment:** If writing daily feels daunting, start with a smaller goal. Maybe aim to write in your journal a few times a week instead of daily, or even once a week at first. You can always increase the frequency as it becomes more integrated into your routine.\n\n3. **Be Kind to Yourself:** Remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to miss a day or two. The goal is not perfection; it's about progress and allowing yourself the grace to adjust as needed.\n\n4. **Reflect on the Purpose:** Revisit why you started this practice. When you remember the positive impact it can have on how you view yourself and your journey, it can motivate you to keep going, even if it looks different from what you initially envisioned.\n\n5. **Share Your Journey:** Consider sharing your experience with someone close to you, like Morgan or a friend. Having an accountability partner can lighten the load and keep you motivated.\n\nHow do these suggestions sit with you? Do any resonate as something you might want to try if you find yourself struggling to maintain the practice?"

I really like the idea of starting with a smaller commitment, like writing a few times a week instead of pressuring myself to do it every day.

I\u2019ll definitely try that.\n\nBeing kind to myself is something I struggle with, so that's a good reminder. And I like the thought of sharing this journey with Morgan; I think we could encourage each other in our practices. \n\nOverall, I feel more hopeful about this gratitude journal idea and how it could help me shift my mindset. I\u2019m really grateful for these suggestions and for the space to talk about these feelings. Thank you!"
