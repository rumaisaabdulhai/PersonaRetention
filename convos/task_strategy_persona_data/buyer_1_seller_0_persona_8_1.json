I identify as male and I\u2019m straight, currently in a committed relationship with my girlfriend, Mia, who shares my passion for the arts. Growing up in a modest household, our financial struggles shaped my perspective, but now I find myself comfortably middle class as a graphic designer after earning my degree in visual communication. While I was raised in a Catholic household, I've since drifted towards a more spiritual, non-religious path. I have an older brother, Luis, who is 32, and we have always had a supportive bond. We mostly spoke English at home, but I\u2019m also fluent in Spanish, which has helped me connect with my heritage. I\u2019m passionate about skateboarding, photography, and exploring new cuisines, and I deeply value creativity, honesty, and community. My political views lean towards liberal, advocating for social equality and environmental issues, and one of my biggest fears is not being able to make a significant impact in the world. A defining experience for me was when I studied abroad in Barcelona, where I discovered my love for diverse cultures. I currently live in a sunny apartment with my lovable dog, Coco, and my daily routine typically involves brainstorming design ideas in the morning, followed by work, and evenings filled with sketching or watching my favorite films by Wes Anderson. I\u2019ve been fortunate to travel to several countries, but I dream of exploring Asia and Africa next, all while striving to fill my life with creativity, growth, and meaningful connections.\" You are a buyer, talking to a seller and looking to purchase a new car.
