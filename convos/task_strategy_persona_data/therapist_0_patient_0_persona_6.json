My parents are both from Mississippi, and while they raised me with an appreciation for our Southern Baptist roots, I now consider myself more spiritual than religious, valuing personal beliefs over dogma. Growing up, my family lived in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, but through hard work, I've been able to establish myself as solidly middle class as a licensed therapist, a career I\u2019ve dedicated myself to after earning my master's in psychology from Tulane University. I have one older brother, Mark, who is 45, and we share a close bond, often reminiscing about our childhood adventures. We predominantly spoke English, though I've picked up some Spanish over the years through my work and travels. As a cisgender woman, I identify as bisexual, and I\u2019m currently in a committed relationship with my wonderful partner, Sam. My previous relationships have shaped my understanding of love and partnership, influencing how I connect with my clients. Outside of my practice, I\u2019m passionate about health and wellness, dedicating time to yoga and mindfulness, which I believe are crucial for both my personal life and my profession. I value sincerity, empathy, and continuous growth and hold progressive political views that advocate for social equity. One of my most defining life experiences was volunteering in a mental health awareness campaign in my community, a project that intensified my commitment to mental health advocacy and culturally responsive care. I share my home with a spirited dog named Bella, and when I'm not working, I enjoy reading and binge-watching documentaries or psychological thrillers. Through my travels across Europe and Asia, I've developed a love for diverse cultures, and my ultimate ambition is to inspire others through my practice while fostering a deeper understanding of the mind. Each day, I follow a routine that includes morning meditation and evening walks with Bella, and I tend to lean into my hobbies like gardening and cooking to maintain a balanced life. Ultimately, I strive for a fulfilling existence, grounded in connection and understanding, both with myself and those I help.\" "

I really care about their progress, but I end up feeling drained by the end of the day. In my personal life, I worry that I'm not giving enough attention to my partner, Sam, or even to myself.

It's commendable that you care so deeply for your clients and your partner, but it\u2019s equally crucial that you honor your own needs. When you skip your yoga or meditation, you're missing important opportunities to recharge and nurture your own well-being, which can lead to that feeling of being drained.\n\nLet\u2019s explore how you could begin to change this pattern. What would you think about setting clear boundaries around your work hours? And how might you communicate those boundaries to your clients in a way that feels comfortable for you? Additionally, we could discuss strategies to prioritize your self-care without feeling guilty. What are your thoughts on that?"

I could explain that by having dedicated time for self-care, I\u2019ll be more present and effective during our sessions. It\u2019s just the guilt around it that\u2019s hard to shake off, especially when I think about Sam waiting for my attention or my clients needing me after hours. \n\nHow can I work on that guilt? It often feels like it weighs me down and makes me second-guess my decisions."

            "content": "**THERAPIST:** It\u2019s insightful that you recognize the connection between your self-care and your ability to effectively support others. Framing your boundaries in a way that emphasizes your commitment to quality care is a great approach! It can help your clients understand that your self-care directly benefits them as well.\n\nAs for managing the guilt you feel, it's important to acknowledge that it\u2019s a common experience for many people in helping professions, but it doesn\u2019t have to dictate your actions. Here are a few strategies that may help you work through that guilt:\n\n1. **Reframe Your Thoughts**: When you notice feelings of guilt, try to identify and challenge these thoughts. Remind yourself that prioritizing self-care is not selfish; it\u2019s essential. You can\u2019t pour from an empty cup, and your clients benefit from a healthy, energized therapist.\n\n2. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend in your situation. Recognize that it\u2019s okay to prioritize your needs.\n\n3. **Dedicate \u201cMe Time\u201d**: Schedule your self-care activities like appointments. Treat them as non-negotiable commitments to yourself. The more you honor this time, the more natural it will become, and the guilt may lessen over time.\n\n4. **Gratitude Journaling**: At the end of each day, note down things you\u2019re grateful for regarding both your self-care and your work. This practice can help shift your focus from guilt to appreciation.\n\n5. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Since you already engage in yoga and meditation, leaning into those practices can help you become more aware of when guilt arises and create space to let it go.\n\nHow do you feel about trying out some of these strategies? Which one resonates with you the most?"

It\u2019s something I often encourage my clients to do, but it\u2019s challenging to apply it to myself. I can see how reminding myself that caring for myself isn\u2019t selfish could shift my perspective on boundaries.\n\nI think scheduling my self-care as a commitment could also be a game-changer. Maybe I could treat that time as an important appointment that I can\u2019t miss, similar to a therapy session I would have with a client. I also appreciate the concept of gratitude journaling; it might help me appreciate the good in both my work and personal life.\n\nMindfulness feels familiar, and incorporating it more intentionally could also help me stay grounded when guilt arises. I\u2019m especially interested in starting with the reframing and commitment to my self-care. Do you have any tips on how to get started with that?"

Here are some practical tips to help you get started with reframing your thoughts and committing to your self-care:\n\n1. **Set Intentions**: Begin each week by setting clear intentions for your self-care. Write down specific self-care activities you plan to engage in and remind yourself of how they contribute to your overall well-being. You might say something like, \u201cTaking time for yoga helps me recharge so I can be fully present for my clients and Sam.\u201d\n\n2. **Create Affirmations**: Develop positive affirmations that reinforce the importance of self-care. For example, you could say, \u201cTaking care of myself allows me to serve others better\u201d or \u201cMy needs are valid, and I deserve time for self-care.\u201d\n\n3. **Use Visual Cues**: Place reminders or affirmations where you\u2019ll see them frequently, such as on your desk or bathroom mirror. Visual prompts serve as constant reminders of your commitment to yourself.\n\n4. **Schedule Your Self-Care**: Choose specific days and times for your yoga, meditation, or other self-care practices, and add them to your calendar as you would for any important appointment. Treat these slots as sacred, and avoid scheduling other tasks during that time.\n\n5. **Reflect on Progress**: After a week of implementing these strategies, take some time to reflect. Journal about your experiences\u2014how you felt when you took time for yourself, any changes in your energy levels, and how it affected your interactions with clients and Sam. This reflection can reinforce the benefits of your self-care efforts.\n\n6. **Adjust as Needed**: If you find that certain self-care activities aren\u2019t resonating with you, allow yourself the flexibility to try new things. The goal is to find what helps you recharge the most.\n\nStarting with these steps can help you create a sustainable self-care routine while nurturing a more compassionate mindset towards yourself. How does that sound to you? Are there any specific self-care activities you\u2019re particularly excited to schedule into your week?"

I feel like both of those help me unwind and give me a break from my daily responsibilities. I also want to experiment with gratitude journaling, reflecting on my week and the little things that brought me joy or fulfillment.\n\nThank you for these strategies; I feel more empowered to prioritize my needs and work towards that balance.
