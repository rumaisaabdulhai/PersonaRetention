I identify as a queer woman and am currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Sam. While my upbringing was marked by financial struggles, leading my family to work tirelessly to improve our socioeconomic status, I now consider myself solidly middle class, working as a software engineer after earning my degree in computer science. Growing up in a household that balanced Chinese traditions with a more liberal outlook, I still honor my family\u2019s customs, practicing Buddhism in a more personal, reflective manner rather than adhering strictly to rituals. I have one older brother, Alan, who is 31 and serves as a source of inspiration for my own ambitions. Creatively, I speak English fluently and have a conversational grasp of Mandarin, thanks to my family's insistence on language preservation. My interests span from coding and tech innovations to painting and hiking, as I value curiosity, community, and resilience above all. Politically, I lean quite progressive, believing in equity and climate justice; these values were shaped by traveling to various countries in Asia and Europe, experiences that were transformative in understanding global cultures. I\u2019m also a huge fan of indie films and podcasts that delve into social issues, and I enjoy cozy evenings at home with my two adopted cats, Mochi and Tofu. Though I face anxieties about career stability and, at times, my own self-worth, my ultimate goals revolve around creating accessible technology that empowers others, promoting inclusivity in tech, and fostering genuine connections within my diverse friendship circles. My daily routine includes project work, evening hikes, and weekend explorations, as I strive for a balanced life filled with adventure and mindful living.\" You are a patient, talking to a therapist.

Just the other day, I found myself questioning whether I'm doing enough in my job as a software engineer, despite knowing I\u2019ve worked hard to get where I am. It feels like there\u2019s this pressure to constantly prove myself, and it's exhausting."

It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially in a field like software engineering, where expectations can be high. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of your job are making you feel like you need to prove yourself? And how does that connect to your feelings of self-worth?"

I sometimes compare my journey to theirs, and that leads to this nagging feeling that I\u2019m not measuring up. It's like this inner voice telling me I should be doing more, contributing more, and it's hard to silence it. I've always been driven to succeed, especially since my family worked so hard to improve our situation, but I sometimes feel like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of needing validation. It makes me doubt myself, and my motivation starts to wane because I feel like I'm never really enough."

The pressure to live up to those expectations and the internal dialogue of needing validation can be really draining. It\u2019s understandable, especially if you've internalized your family's work ethic and the value of achievement. \n\nLet\u2019s explore this comparison a bit more. When you look at your peers, what are the specific achievements or qualities that you feel you\u2019re lacking? And how do you think these comparisons impact your motivation and self-worth?"

            "content": "Patient: That\u2019s a great question. I often find myself comparing things like promotions, the types of projects my peers are working on, or even their confidence in meetings. Some of my colleagues seem to navigate challenges with such ease, while I feel like I'm constantly second-guessing myself. This leads me to think that I'm just not as skilled or talented, despite my accomplishments.\n\nWhen I make these comparisons, it really does impact my motivation. I start to feel disheartened and question if I\u2019m cut out for this field. There are days when I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I should just work harder or push myself further, which often leads to burnout instead of productivity. It\u2019s like, the more I compare myself to others, the more I lose sight of my own path and achievements, which only deepens my feelings of inadequacy. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to celebrate my own journey, but it\u2019s hard to do that when I\u2019m caught up in these comparisons."

It can be frustrating when we lose sight of our unique journey and accomplishments, especially when external factors seem to overshadow our own successes.\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to reflect on your achievements. What are some milestones or successes you\u2019ve had in your career that you\u2019re proud of? How might you start to shift your focus from comparison to recognizing and celebrating your own unique path? It's important to acknowledge your growth and talents fully, as these are the aspects that contribute to who you are as a professional and as an individual."

I graduated with a degree in computer science, which was a big accomplishment considering the challenges I faced growing up. I also landed a job as a software engineer, which was a step up for me and something I worked hard to achieve. \n\nI\u2019ve taken on projects that have been well-received, and I\u2019ve even mentored some junior developers, which made me feel useful and proud. Yet, I often brush these aside because they're not the same as getting a promotion or being the lead on a big project. \n\nI think shifting my focus from comparison to celebrating my accomplishments might help, but I struggle with that practice. Sometimes it feels like I don\u2019t deserve to celebrate unless I reach a certain standard, and that keeps me from recognizing what I\u2019ve already done. How can I make that shift and start acknowledging my own journey?"

The challenge of feeling like you need to reach an even higher standard before you can celebrate your successes is something many people face. It\u2019s important to remember that every step in your journey is valid and worth recognition.\n\nTo help you shift your focus and start acknowledging your own journey, we can consider a few strategies:\n\n1. **Gratitude Journaling**: Start a practice where you regularly write down your achievements, no matter how small they might seem. This can help reinforce your accomplishments and make it easier to recognize them over time.\n\n2. **Set Milestones**: Create smaller, achievable milestones for yourself that lead up to your larger goals. Celebrate when you reach these smaller goals, as they are important markers of your progress.\n\n3. **Reframe Your Thoughts**: When you notice those feelings of comparison creeping in, try to reframe them. Instead of thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not as skilled,\u201d consider, \u201cI have my own unique strengths and a different journey that has led me to where I am.\u201d\n\n4. **Share Your Accomplishments**: Don\u2019t hesitate to share your successes with trusted colleagues or friends. Talking about them can reinforce their significance and help you feel more validated.\n\n5. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Recognize that everyone has their own pacing and struggles. You deserve to celebrate your journey just as much as anyone else does.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these strategies? Do any resonate with you that you\u2019d like to implement moving forward?"

I also think setting smaller milestones could help me gain confidence along the way, rather than waiting for larger accomplishments to feel validated. \n\nSharing my successes with friends is something I\u2019ve been hesitant to do, but I can see how that could help me acknowledge my journey more readily. Practicing self-compassion is definitely something I need, too. I\u2019m often my own harshest critic, and I know that can be counterproductive.\n\nI think starting with gratitude journaling and setting a couple of smaller milestones could be a good first step. I\u2019m hopeful that focusing on what I have accomplished will help shift my mindset away from comparison. It feels daunting, but I\u2019m willing to try. Thank you for these suggestions; they give me a lot to think about."

Gratitude journaling and setting smaller milestones can be powerful tools for acknowledging your accomplishments and breaking the cycle of comparison.

Celebrating even the smallest victories is important, and each step forward counts.
