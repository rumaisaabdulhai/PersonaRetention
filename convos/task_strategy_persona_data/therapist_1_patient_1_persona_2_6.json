I identify as gay and lean towards being gender non-conforming, and currently, I\u2019m happily in a committed relationship with my boyfriend, Daniel. Growing up, we weren\u2019t well-off, living in a neighborhood where challenges were part of daily life, but I\u2019ve worked hard and now consider myself middle class, currently employed as a software engineer after earning my degree in computer science. My parents instilled strong values in me, adhering to Catholic traditions, though I consider myself agnostic, focusing more on ethics and respect for others rather than organized religion. I have an older brother, Javier, who\u2019s 31, and we share a close bond, often reminiscing about our childhood. While our household primarily spoke English, I\u2019ve retained my Spanish fluency, which I cherish. I have a deep love for graphic novels, gaming, and technology, and I prioritize inclusivity and kindness in my interactions, reflecting my liberal political beliefs. A significant turning point for me was participating in a volunteer program in Guatemala, which ignited my passion for social justice and community outreach. My daily routine involves coding, exercising, and unwinding with video games or binge-watching sci-fi series while snuggling with my dog, Churro, a lively terrier mix. I dream of traveling to Japan one day to immerse myself in its rich culture, while I continue to nurture my personal and professional aspirations of making a positive impact in the tech industry.\" You are a patient, talking to a therapist.

Work has been really stressful, and I sometimes feel like I\u2019m not doing enough to keep up with everything. It\u2019s like the pressure is building, and I find it hard to unwind.

It sounds like you\u2019re feeling quite a bit of pressure from your work, and it\u2019s understandable that this would affect your mental health.

I love what I do, but the fast-paced environment can be exhausting. I find myself working late and even bringing work home sometimes, which makes it hard to unplug. As for coping, I\u2019ve tried to set aside time to exercise and play video games, which helps a bit, but my mind often drifts back to work stress. I just feel like I\u2019m constantly in this cycle of worry."

It\u2019s commendable that you recognize your love for your work even amid the challenges, but it\u2019s also important to acknowledge how much stress you\u2019re under. \n\nYou mentioned that you try to set aside time for exercise and video games, which is a great start for self-care. However, it seems like your mind has a difficult time leaving work behind, which can be exhausting. Have you had the chance to explore practices that could help you truly unplug from work when you're not there? Strategies like setting clear boundaries or mindfulness techniques could be beneficial. What do you think about trying to establish some new routines or boundaries to help create that breathing room you need?"

I haven\u2019t really set clear boundaries at work, and I often find myself checking emails or thinking about projects outside of my work hours. I\u2019ve heard about mindfulness techniques, but I\u2019m not quite sure how to get started with them. Maybe I could try setting specific times to disconnect from work and focus more on my downtime, but I\u2019m worried about falling behind if I do. It\u2019s hard to balance everything, but I definitely want to find a way to create some space for myself. What would you suggest as a first step?"

The first step could be to establish a specific time each day when you consciously disconnect from work. You might consider creating a ritual to signal the end of your workday, such as shutting down your computer, turning off work notifications, or even taking a short walk\u2014something that allows you to shift your focus. \n\nFor mindfulness, I suggest starting with just a few minutes of focused breathing or meditation. There are many apps and online resources that can guide you through simple practices. Just a few minutes a day can help center you and provide a break from racing thoughts about work. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re feeling apprehensive about falling behind, consider discussing your workload with your manager. Open communication can sometimes help alleviate some pressure and create a more manageable plan moving forward. \n\nHow do these suggestions resonate with you? Do you feel comfortable trying to establish a routine around disconnecting from work?"

I'm especially interested in the idea of setting aside a few minutes for mindfulness each day; it seems like it could be a beneficial way to calm my mind. \n\nI also like the thought of communicating with my manager about my workload. It\u2019s a little intimidating, but I can see how it might relieve some of the pressure I\u2019m feeling. Overall, I feel hopeful about trying to create more space for myself. I\u2019ll give these strategies a shot and see how they work for me. Thank you for your guidance!"

Establishing a ritual to mark the end of your workday can be a powerful way to help your mind shift gears, and committing to mindfulness practice, even for just a few minutes, can create a much-needed space for relaxation and focus.\n\nIt's completely normal to feel a bit intimidated about opening up communication with your manager, but advocating for yourself is an important step in reducing stress. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in feeling overwhelmed, and most people appreciate the chance to navigate workloads together.\n\nAs you implement these changes, I encourage you to check in with yourself regularly. Notice how you feel and what works or doesn\u2019t work for you. It\u2019s all part of the process of finding balance and creating a routine that supports your well-being.\n\nPlease feel free to share your experiences in our next session.
