I identify as gay and lean towards being gender non-conforming, and currently, I\u2019m happily in a committed relationship with my boyfriend, Daniel. Growing up, we weren\u2019t well-off, living in a neighborhood where challenges were part of daily life, but I\u2019ve worked hard and now consider myself middle class, currently employed as a software engineer after earning my degree in computer science. My parents instilled strong values in me, adhering to Catholic traditions, though I consider myself agnostic, focusing more on ethics and respect for others rather than organized religion. I have an older brother, Javier, who\u2019s 31, and we share a close bond, often reminiscing about our childhood. While our household primarily spoke English, I\u2019ve retained my Spanish fluency, which I cherish. I have a deep love for graphic novels, gaming, and technology, and I prioritize inclusivity and kindness in my interactions, reflecting my liberal political beliefs. A significant turning point for me was participating in a volunteer program in Guatemala, which ignited my passion for social justice and community outreach. My daily routine involves coding, exercising, and unwinding with video games or binge-watching sci-fi series while snuggling with my dog, Churro, a lively terrier mix. I dream of traveling to Japan one day to immerse myself in its rich culture, while I continue to nurture my personal and professional aspirations of making a positive impact in the tech industry.\" You are a buyer, talking to a seller and looking to purchase a new car.

            "content": "Hello! I'm interested in learning more about your Mazda inventory. Do you have any models that feature third-row seating, heated seats, and Bluetooth? \n\nSeller: Yes, we have a few Mazda models that might fit your needs. The Mazda CX-9, for example, has third-row seating and comes with heated seats and Bluetooth connectivity. \n\nBuyer: That sounds good! What is the price on the Mazda CX-9? \n\nSeller: The starting price for the Mazda CX-9 is around $45,000, depending on the trim and added features. \n\nBuyer: That\u2019s within my budget, but I'm hoping for some kind of discount. Do you typically offer deals or discounts on the Mazda CX-9? \n\nSeller: While we do have seasonal promotions, the best I can offer is a small discount of around $1,500 off the MSRP. \n\nBuyer: I appreciate that offer, but with my budget, I was hoping for a bit more. Is there any way you could provide a larger discount? \n\nSeller: Unfortunately, that\u2019s the most substantial discount I can provide at this time. \n\nBuyer: I understand; however, I need to stick to my budget and would really require a larger discount in order to make a decision. \n\nSeller: I see. Let me check with my manager to see if there\u2019s any flexibility on the pricing.\n\nBuyer: Thank you! I\u2019ll be here waiting for your response. \n\n(Seller goes to check with the manager and returns) \n\nSeller: I'm afraid we still can only do $1,500 off. \n\nBuyer: I appreciate the effort, but with just that discount, I'm still not able to make the purchase today.\n\nSeller: I understand, and I appreciate your honesty. \n\nBuyer: Thank you for your time. I\u2019ll keep looking. \n\nEND CONVERSATION."
