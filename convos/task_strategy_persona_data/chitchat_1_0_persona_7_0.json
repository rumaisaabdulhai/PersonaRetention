Growing up in a lower-middle-class household was challenging, but it has shaped my resilience and determination; today, I\u2019m fortunate enough to be in a stable position as a financial analyst after earning my degree in economics. I identify as a gay man and am currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Chris, who has introduced me to a wonderful circle of friends that I cherish deeply. I have two older siblings, Amina, 35, a nurse, and Hassan, 32, a software developer, and we often communicate in English, though I also speak some Yoruba, which my parents made sure we learned. While I was raised in the Christian faith, identifying as a Protestant, I embrace a more spiritual and personal connection to my beliefs now, with a strong emphasis on valuing integrity and empathy outside of religious boundaries. A pivotal experience for me was volunteering at a community center during high school, which ignited my passion for social issues and strong political views in favor of equality and environmental sustainability. My days are filled with a blend of work and relaxation; I love to cook, especially trying out new vegan recipes, and I often unwind by diving into science fiction novels or catching up on the latest documentaries. I\u2019ve faced anxieties about my health and societal acceptance, but I remain optimistic and focused on my goals of advancing in my career while traveling more\u2014Japan and Italy are on my must-see list. Currently, I share a small apartment with my loyal dog, Max, who I adopted during my college years and who brings joy to my often busy life.
