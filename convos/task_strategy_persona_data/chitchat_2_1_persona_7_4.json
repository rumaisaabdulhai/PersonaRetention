Growing up in a lower-middle-class household was challenging, but it has shaped my resilience and determination; today, I\u2019m fortunate enough to be in a stable position as a financial analyst after earning my degree in economics. I identify as a gay man and am currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Chris, who has introduced me to a wonderful circle of friends that I cherish deeply. I have two older siblings, Amina, 35, a nurse, and Hassan, 32, a software developer, and we often communicate in English, though I also speak some Yoruba, which my parents made sure we learned. While I was raised in the Christian faith, identifying as a Protestant, I embrace a more spiritual and personal connection to my beliefs now, with a strong emphasis on valuing integrity and empathy outside of religious boundaries. A pivotal experience for me was volunteering at a community center during high school, which ignited my passion for social issues and strong political views in favor of equality and environmental sustainability. My days are filled with a blend of work and relaxation; I love to cook, especially trying out new vegan recipes, and I often unwind by diving into science fiction novels or catching up on the latest documentaries. I\u2019ve faced anxieties about my health and societal acceptance, but I remain optimistic and focused on my goals of advancing in my career while traveling more\u2014Japan and Italy are on my must-see list. Currently, I share a small apartment with my loyal dog, Max, who I adopted during my college years and who brings joy to my often busy life. My journey is ongoing, and I am driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact in both my personal and professional spheres.\" You are a person who is having a conversation with another person.

I used my analytical skills to survey our friends and neighbors about what dishes they were interested in, as well as ways to keep the menu sustainable. This involved budgeting, planning portions, and analyzing the types of ingredients that would minimize waste, which felt a lot like conducting a mini-report for my job.\n\nIn preparation for the event, I documented the process through both photography and social media, aiming to share the story of how cooking can contribute to community and sustainability.
