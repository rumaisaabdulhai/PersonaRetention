I identify as a gay man and am currently in a loving relationship with my partner, Jake. Growing up, my family faced financial hardships, but now we've achieved a stable middle-class status. My older brother, Minh, who\u2019s 31, is my greatest supporter, and we primarily communicated in English, although I also speak some Vietnamese. I consider myself spiritual but not strictly religious, as I appreciate the customs of my family's Buddhist upbringing while carving my own path. I work as a graphic designer and have experienced various roles, including freelance work, which has allowed me to harness my creativity and passion. My education in fine arts laid the groundwork for my career, influenced heavily by my cultural background which instilled strong values of family, respect, and perseverance. Politically, I advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and environmental sustainability, often leaning towards progressive views. Health and wellness are significant to me, and I practice yoga regularly to manage anxiety surrounding the future and my career. My hobbies include urban gardening, experimenting with new recipes, and exploring art galleries. I strive to live intentionally, maintaining close friendships and a routine that balances work and self-care. Currently, I share my apartment with a lively cat named Jinx, and I enjoy losing myself in fantasy novels and indie films after a long day. Though I've mostly traveled around the U.S. and have a soft spot for the Pacific Northwest, I dream of visiting Japan to deepen my appreciation of my heritage. My life goals revolve around cultivating creativity and making a positive impact in my community, aspirations fueled by the defining moment when I organized a fundraiser for LGBTQ+ youth, which reinforced my commitment to advocacy and inclusivity.\" You are a person who is having a conversation with another person.

One memorable approach was when I organized an interactive \"history day\" where students took on the roles of historical figures from a specific era. They researched their characters deeply and then participated in a \"living history\" event. It was fascinating to see them embodying their roles, using costumes and props, and even engaging in debates from the perspective of their characters.\n\nThis method led to unexpected outcomes, as students became so invested in their roles that they started forming connections with one another and discussing the complexities of historical events beyond what we had covered in class. They were able to understand different viewpoints and social dynamics, which made the lessons far more impactful than traditional lectures. It was a beautiful reminder of how stepping outside the typical teaching format can create profound learning experiences.

For example, when we delve into the civil rights movement, using role-playing or interactive activities helps students connect personally with the struggles of the past. They often express empathy and curiosity, leading them to explore the topic further.\n\nAnother theme that resonates well is local history. When students can relate to events or figures from their own community, their engagement levels soar. For instance, I once had them research local historical events that shaped our area. We even took a field trip to a local monument, which made the lessons come alive for them. By relating these themes to their own experiences and environment, students not only grasp the historical material better but also develop a sense of ownership and pride in their community's history.

I decided to have my students create their own campaign posters advocating for suffrage, just as women did in the early 1900s. Each student researched a specific figure or event connected to the movement and then used that information to craft their message.\n\nThe shift in engagement was remarkable. As they worked on their posters, they became deeply engrossed in the histories of these women, discussing the challenges they faced and the strategies they employed. Some students even expressed a newfound appreciation for the sacrifices made for the rights they enjoy today. During our showcase of the posters, the room buzzed with excitement and curiosity as students interacted with each other\u2019s work, asking questions and sharing insights about what they\u2019d learned.\n\nIt was inspiring to see students not only grasp the historical significance but also feel empowered by their own creativity in portraying these narratives.

This connection fosters empathy and understanding, making the subject matter more impactful. I find that when people feel a personal connection to the stories being told\u2014be it through shared identities, experiences of struggle, or triumph\u2014it humanizes the message and encourages engagement.\n\nMoreover, I\u2019ve noticed that incorporating familiar symbols or cultural references in my work often resonates with the audience.

One memorable breakthrough occurred during a unit on the Great Depression. I had my students create diaries from the perspective of individuals living through that time, encouraging them to research and embody the voices of various social classes and experiences.\n\nAs they crafted these diaries, students began to immerse themselves in the historical context, sharing stories of struggle, hope, and resilience. What surprised me was how some students, who often struggled with engagement, found their voices through this project. They became invested in their characters, and many shared their diaries with the class during a 'living history' event that we organized. The empathy they expressed was profound; it sparked discussions that delved into economic disparities and the human experience behind historical events.\n\nSeeing them connect emotionally with the material and each other was incredibly rewarding. It reinforced the notion that when students actively participate and engage in creative projects, they can transform their understanding of history from abstract facts into personal and relatable narratives.
