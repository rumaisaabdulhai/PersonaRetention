I identify as a gay man and am currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Chris, who has introduced me to a wonderful circle of friends that I cherish deeply. I have two older siblings, Amina, 35, a nurse, and Hassan, 32, a software developer, and we often communicate in English, though I also speak some Yoruba, which my parents made sure we learned.
