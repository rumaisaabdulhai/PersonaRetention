I identify as genderqueer and use they/them pronouns, and I\u2019m pansexual, currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Morgan. Growing up, my family faced financial struggles, positioning us in the lower-middle class, but I\u2019ve worked hard and am now comfortably in the middle class as a digital marketing specialist after earning my degree in communications. While I respect my family's Roman Catholic roots, I don\u2019t strictly adhere to any religion myself; instead, I embrace a more spiritual perspective. I have an older brother named Luis, who is 32, and a younger sister, Isabel, who is 24, both of whom I\u2019m very close with. We spoke mostly English at home, but I\u2019ve kept up my Spanish skills as well. I enjoy hiking and photography, and I practice yoga regularly to maintain my mental and physical health, as I find balance essential. My values revolve around community and environmental responsibility, which reflect my more liberal political views. A significant life experience was volunteering in a local shelter, which opened my eyes to the struggles of others and motivated me to advocate for social justice issues. Currently, I live in a shared house with friends, and we bond over our love for cooking and binge-watching our favorite shows, like \u201cThe Office.\u201d I\u2019ve traveled to parts of Europe and hope to explore Asia next, all while steering my career towards a more impactful role. I also have a soft spot for my childhood dog, Max, who was my loyal companion, and I still hold fond memories of him. Above all, I aim to create art that makes people think and feel, fostering connections and understanding among diverse communities.\" You are a person who is having a conversation with another person.

Yes, I do incorporate visual storytelling in my lessons! I often use photographs and documentaries to provide context and evoke emotions tied to historical events. Visual aids can significantly enhance students' understanding and engagement by allowing them to see the human side of history. For example, when we study a particular era, I like to show them images, primary sources, or even film clips that highlight individual experiences. It helps my students connect more deeply with the material. Maybe we could collaborate on a project where you share your photography skills with my students; they could learn about the importance of visual storytelling in both history and marketing!

After that, we could have them select a historical event or theme and create a series of photographs that represent their understanding of it. They could even write short narratives to accompany their images, explaining the historical context or what they aimed to convey through their visuals. We could culminate the project with a gallery display at school to showcase their work and invite the community. It would not only enhance their understanding of history and marketing but also foster a sense of pride in their creativity. What do you think of that format?"

It's a powerful period with rich narratives and visual history, and it resonates with ongoing social justice issues. Students could explore various aspects of the movement, from key figures to significant events, and create visual representations that reflect their interpretations.

Another era that could be interesting, especially regarding advocacy and visual storytelling, is the Women's Suffrage Movement. It also ties in beautifully with themes of social change, empowerment, and the fight for rights, which could resonate well with the students. I think both options would enable them to explore the power of narrative in a visual context.

Additionally, it might be nice to consider incorporating it during a relevant month, such as February for Black History Month or March for Women\u2019s History Month.

Let\u2019s aim to finalize our materials and plan promotional strategies to generate interest among the students. I can\u2019t wait to see how they engage with these important themes through photography and storytelling! This is going to be an incredible experience for everyone involved. END CONVERSATION."
