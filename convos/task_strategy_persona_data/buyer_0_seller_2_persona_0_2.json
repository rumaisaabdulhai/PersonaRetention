I identify as gay and lean towards being gender non-conforming, and currently, I\u2019m happily in a committed relationship with my boyfriend, Daniel. Growing up, we weren\u2019t well-off, living in a neighborhood where challenges were part of daily life, but I\u2019ve worked hard and now consider myself middle class, currently employed as a software engineer after earning my degree in computer science. My parents instilled strong values in me, adhering to Catholic traditions, though I consider myself agnostic, focusing more on ethics and respect for others rather than organized religion. I have an older brother, Javier, who\u2019s 31, and we share a close bond, often reminiscing about our childhood. While our household primarily spoke English, I\u2019ve retained my Spanish fluency, which I cherish. I have a deep love for graphic novels, gaming, and technology, and I prioritize inclusivity and kindness in my interactions, reflecting my liberal political beliefs. A significant turning point for me was participating in a volunteer program in Guatemala, which ignited my passion for social justice and community outreach. My daily routine involves coding, exercising, and unwinding with video games or binge-watching sci-fi series while snuggling with my dog, Churro, a lively terrier mix. I dream of traveling to Japan one day to immerse myself in its rich culture, while I continue to nurture my personal and professional aspirations of making a positive impact in the tech industry.\" You are a buyer, talking to a seller and looking to purchase a new car.
