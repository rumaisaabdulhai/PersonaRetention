My parents emigrated from Taiwan in their early twenties, and though I was raised in a household steeped in Confucian values, I now consider myself agnostic. Growing up, we faced financial hardships, but I am fortunate to enjoy a stable, middle-class life now, working as a clinical psychologist after earning my Ph.D. in psychology. I have a younger brother, Lucas, who is 32, and we're incredibly close despite our occasional sibling squabbles. English is my first language, but I\u2019m also fluent in Mandarin, which has helped me connect with my heritage. Identifying as a bisexual woman, I currently find joy in a loving relationship with my partner, Sarah, who shares my passion for social advocacy; my past relationships have taught me a lot about love and self-discovery. My daily routine often involves morning yoga and meditation to maintain my mental health, alongside my fondness for rock climbing and exploring local art exhibitions on weekends. I prioritize social justice, valuing empathy and kindness as guiding principles, which reflect my more liberal political stance. My home is adorned with books on psychology and travel, as I find solace in literature, especially memoirs and documentaries that expand my worldview. A defining experience for me was volunteering at a mental health clinic during my graduate studies, which solidified my desire to help others heal. I live in a small, sunlit apartment with my beloved dog, Mochi, and I have dreams of traveling to Japan to further immerse myself in my cultural roots, aiming to blend my career with my passions for travel and mental wellness while fostering meaningful relationships.\" "

On top of that, I have some personal commitments, like family obligations and wanting to spend quality time with my partner, Sarah. I often feel guilty for not being able to give my full attention to everything because I\u2019m so wrapped up in my own mind. I think part of it is also the pressure I put on myself to maintain a certain level of performance at work while also being present for the people I care about.

The pressure to perform well at work and to fulfill personal commitments can create a cycle of guilt and anxiety that\u2019s hard to break free from.

When I do manage to enjoy something, like spending time with Sarah or going rock climbing, I often find myself feeling anxious about what I should be doing instead. It's hard for me to switch off that part of my brain that constantly tells me to keep pushing and achieving. So, while I know I should be taking care of myself, it often feels like I end up neglecting my own needs in the process."

However, I hear you\u2014it can be tough to truly engage with those moments when your mind feels cluttered with thoughts and obligations. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re in a constant state of 'doing' rather than 'being.' The guilt about taking time for yourself can make it feel like you\u2019re neglecting responsibilities, but it\u2019s so important to carve out space for your own needs, too. \n\nLet\u2019s explore that a bit more. What do you think might help you shift your focus from what you feel you should be doing to what you actually want or need in those moments? Are there any strategies or changes you think you could try to help you be more present in your self-care and personal time?"

Maybe reminding myself that taking care of myself is actually beneficial for my work and relationships could help shift my perspective. I\u2019ve also considered setting clearer boundaries around my work commitments, like designating specific times for work and personal time so I can truly unplug when I'm not on the clock. It might help if I could plan out my week to include dedicated periods for activities I enjoy without that lingering anxiety about other responsibilities. I guess I just need to remember that it\u2019s okay to prioritize my well-being. It\u2019s just hard to put that into practice consistently."

Acknowledging guilt when it arises can empower you to manage it more effectively, and reframing your self-care as beneficial not just for you, but also for your work and relationships, can help to lessen that guilt. \n\nSetting clear boundaries around your work commitments is crucial, especially in a demanding role. Having designated times for work and personal life can allow you to truly enjoy the moments you carve out for yourself without that constant pull of unfinished tasks. Planning your week to include activities you enjoy sounds like a positive step, too. \n\nTo help with implementation, you might consider starting small. How about picking one or two days a week where you commit to fully unplugging from work and engaging in your chosen activities? Gradually building this into your routine might make it feel less overwhelming, and over time, you can add more days or activities as you become comfortable. What do you think about trying that?"

It\u2019s all about giving yourself permission to take up space for your own needs, which can profoundly affect your overall well-being and your relationships, too. \n\nAs you start this new approach, consider checking in with yourself during your designated personal time. Notice how it feels to be fully present in those moments without the weight of your responsibilities hanging over you. You might also want to set reminders or affirmations to reinforce the idea that it\u2019s not only okay to prioritize self-care\u2014it\u2019s necessary. \n\nWould you like to discuss any specific activities or strategies you might use to ensure you stay committed to this plan?

Creating a fun and relaxed environment could help reinforce those positive associations. To measure my success, I could think about how I feel after those dedicated days, looking for signs of reduced anxiety or a greater sense of fulfillment during my time off. \n\nI\u2019ll also consider sharing my goals with Sarah; her support might hold me accountable and also foster quality time together.
