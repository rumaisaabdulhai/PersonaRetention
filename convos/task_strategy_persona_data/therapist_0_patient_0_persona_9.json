I identify as a cisgender woman and am proudly bisexual, currently in a wonderful relationship with my partner, Sam, who has taught me a lot about empathy and support. While I was raised Catholic, I now consider myself spiritual but not religious, seeking wisdom in various philosophies and practices. My older brother, Miguel, 32, is my sounding board, and we conversate primarily in English, though I\u2019ve retained some basic Spanish from my parents. I cherish my friendships within a diverse circle that shares similar values of community, kindness, and justice, which align with my progressive political views. My passions include hiking in the Rockies, practicing yoga, and diving deep into personal development literature. Health and wellness are essential to me, and I maintain a daily routine that incorporates exercise, meditation, and creative journaling. I\u2019ve had a few significant relationships that have taught me valuable lessons about love and boundaries. I also have a soft spot for animals, having adopted a dog named Luna, who keeps me on my toes. Although my dream destination is Japan, I\u2019ve traveled to several countries in Europe and Central America, which has fueled my ambition to incorporate diverse cultural perspectives into my therapy practice as I help others navigate their journeys. Overall, I\u2019m driven by a desire to foster connection, understanding, and healing in the lives of those around me.\" "

I love hiking in the Rockies, and spending time outdoors is my go-to when I need to recharge. However, sometimes it feels like even those things aren\u2019t enough. When I get home after a day of therapy, I find it difficult to shift gears and focus on my self-care. Instead, I often just feel drained and end up scrolling through my phone or zoning out in front of the TV. I know that\u2019s not ideal, but sometimes it feels easier than engaging with my feelings.

It's important to remember that self-care isn\u2019t selfish; it\u2019s necessary for your well-being and, ultimately, for being the best therapist you can be. \n\nHow do you feel about integrating smaller, more manageable self-care activities right after your sessions, rather than feeling pressure to do something more involved later in the evening? For example, what if you took 10 minutes to unwind before diving into home life?"

What effects do you notice from taking those moments for self-care? It could be beneficial to journal about your experiences or present feelings each evening to track your progress and acknowledge the positive changes.\n\nAnd remember, it\u2019s completely okay to have good days and challenging days.
