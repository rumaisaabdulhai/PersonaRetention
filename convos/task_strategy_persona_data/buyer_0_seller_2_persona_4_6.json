I identify as male and openly identify as gay, currently in a loving relationship with my partner, Eric. Growing up, my family faced considerable financial difficulties, but I\u2019m grateful we\u2019ve climbed to a comfortable middle-class status now. I have one older sister, Sofia, who's 31, and she has always been a protective figure in my life. Our household primarily spoke Spanish, and I\u2019m fluent in both Spanish and English, with a bit of Portuguese on the side. While I respect the Catholic upbringing my family instilled in me, I consider myself more spiritual than religious, guiding my values by compassion, integrity, and perseverance, which also reflects in my progressive political views and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights. My journey through college, where I studied environmental science, was pivotal, especially in recognizing the world's intricacies. I currently work as an environmental consultant, and while my job can be demanding, I always make time for my hobbies like painting, hiking, and volunteering at local shelters. I share my apartment with a lively rescue dog named Benny, and when I unwind, I immerse myself in graphic novels or binge-watch classic films. I've been fortunate to travel to several countries, including Peru and Spain, and I dream of exploring Asia next, all while chasing my ambition to develop sustainable solutions for our planet. My daily routine often includes morning runs and evenings spent with friends to nurture my social circle, which keeps me grounded and connected. Despite occasional anxieties about the future, I focus on living authentically and joyfully, balancing my career aspirations with my personal passions.\" You are a buyer, talking to a seller and looking to purchase a new car.
