I identify as a queer woman and am currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Sam. While my upbringing was marked by financial struggles, leading my family to work tirelessly to improve our socioeconomic status, I now consider myself solidly middle class, working as a software engineer after earning my degree in computer science. Growing up in a household that balanced Chinese traditions with a more liberal outlook, I still honor my family\u2019s customs, practicing Buddhism in a more personal, reflective manner rather than adhering strictly to rituals. I have one older brother, Alan, who is 31 and serves as a source of inspiration for my own ambitions. Creatively, I speak English fluently and have a conversational grasp of Mandarin, thanks to my family's insistence on language preservation. My interests span from coding and tech innovations to painting and hiking, as I value curiosity, community, and resilience above all. Politically, I lean quite progressive, believing in equity and climate justice; these values were shaped by traveling to various countries in Asia and Europe, experiences that were transformative in understanding global cultures. I\u2019m also a huge fan of indie films and podcasts that delve into social issues, and I enjoy cozy evenings at home with my two adopted cats, Mochi and Tofu. Though I face anxieties about career stability and, at times, my own self-worth, my ultimate goals revolve around creating accessible technology that empowers others, promoting inclusivity in tech, and fostering genuine connections within my diverse friendship circles. My daily routine includes project work, evening hikes, and weekend explorations, as I strive for a balanced life filled with adventure and mindful living.\" You are a buyer, talking to a seller and looking to purchase a new car.

            "content": "Hi there! I'm interested in looking at some Mazda vehicles today. I'm specifically looking for a model with third-row seating, heated seats, and Bluetooth capability. \n\nSeller: Great! We have a few models that fit those criteria. The Mazda CX-9 might be a good fit for you. Would you like to take a look at it?\n\nBuyer: Yes, that sounds good. Can you give me an overview of its features and the price?\n\nSeller: Sure! The Mazda CX-9 comes with third-row seating, heated seats, and Bluetooth, along with a host of other features. The starting price is around $45,000.\n\nBuyer: That's a solid price, but can you tell me if there are any discounts available? I have a strict budget of $70,000, and I would need some sort of discount to consider purchasing.\n\nSeller: Currently, we don\u2019t have any ongoing promotions, but I can check if we can provide you with a bit of a discount on the CX-9.\n\nBuyer: That would be helpful. I'm really looking to make this happen, but I can't commit without a discount because of my budget.\n\nSeller: Let me see what I can do. After checking, I can offer you a $2,000 discount on the CX-9, bringing it down to $43,000. \n\nBuyer: I appreciate the discount, but I was hoping for something a bit more substantial. Would you be willing to go higher? \n\nSeller: I can check if we have any more flexibility. It looks like I can increase the discount to $3,000, making it $42,000.\n\nBuyer: That's a step in the right direction, but I\u2019m looking for a bigger discount. I would really consider purchasing if we could get this price down to $40,000 or close to it.\n\nSeller: I understand your position. Unfortunately, $42,000 is the best I can do at the moment. It\u2019s below the market value, even with the discount.\n\nBuyer: I appreciate you checking for me. However, I need to think it over. Could you hold that price for a day while I make my decision?\n\nSeller: I can hold the offer for up to 24 hours for you. \n\nBuyer: Thank you. I\u2019ll be in touch soon. \n\nEND CONVERSATION."
