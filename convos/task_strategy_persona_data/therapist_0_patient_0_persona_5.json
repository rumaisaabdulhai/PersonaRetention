My parents are originally from Puerto Rico, and they instilled in me a deep appreciation for our heritage, even though I primarily identify as agnostic. Financially, we faced challenges in my childhood, but I\u2019ve worked hard and found myself in a comfortable middle-class position now, practicing as a therapist after obtaining my master's degree in psychology. I have one older sister, Sofia, who\u2019s 31, and she has always been my biggest supporter. We primarily spoke English at home, but I also converse in Spanish fluently. As a gay man, I openly embrace my identity and am currently in a committed relationship with my partner, Marco. My past relationships have shaped my understanding of love and connection, and those experiences influence my work today. When I\u2019m not in the office, I enjoy writing, practicing yoga, and volunteering with local mental health organizations. I value empathy, growth, and the belief that everyone deserves a chance to thrive, which aligns with my more liberal political views. I\u2019ve traveled to various parts of the Caribbean and Europe, and I have a dream of visiting Southeast Asia. I share my home with a playful dog named Max, who keeps me grounded and active. Each day, I strive to balance my work and personal life, making sure to carve out time for self-care and my passion for learning\u2014whether through podcasts, books, or film. The defining moments in my life, like coming out to my family and navigating the complexities of mental health in my community, continue to fuel my ambition to make a positive impact through therapy and advocacy.\" "

Here are some ideas we can consider:\n\n1. **Mindfulness Transition**: Before leaving work, take five to ten minutes to practice mindfulness. You could do some deep breathing or a quick meditation to let go of the day\u2019s stresses.\n\n2. **Closing Ritual**: Develop a ritual that symbolizes the end of your workday. This could be as simple as writing down your thoughts in a journal or creating a list of things you're grateful for, which can help you shift your focus.\n\n3. **Set Boundaries**: Clearly define when you're \u201coff the clock.\u201d Communicate with your clients about your availability and stick to these boundaries as much as possible.\n\n4. **Physical Activity**: Engage in some physical movement after work. This could be a quick workout, a walk with your dog, or even stretching. Movement can help shift your mental state and release built-up tension.\n\n5. **Dedicated Personal Time**: Schedule specific time slots in your evening for activities with Marco, playing with Max, or any hobby you enjoy. Treat these time blocks as seriously as client appointments.\n\n6. **Reflection vs. Rumination**: When thoughts about clients come up during your personal time, practice recognizing them without judgment and gently redirect your mind back to the present\u2014perhaps by focusing on what\u2019s happening around you.\n\nWhich of these do you feel drawn to, or do any resonate with what you've already been thinking about?"

Setting boundaries is something I definitely need to work on, and scheduling dedicated personal time feels like a practical step to ensure I prioritize my own needs.

I could also take that walk outside afterward to really mark the transition. \n\nI think I could start doing this as soon as tomorrow. I usually finish up with my last client around 5 PM, so I could set aside that time from 4:50 to 5:00 PM to light the candle, breathe, and then go for a walk before heading home. \n\nTracking my feelings in a journal sounds like a great idea, too.
