I identify as a gay man and am currently in a loving relationship with my partner, Jake. Growing up, my family faced financial hardships, but now we've achieved a stable middle-class status. My older brother, Minh, who\u2019s 31, is my greatest supporter, and we primarily communicated in English, although I also speak some Vietnamese. I consider myself spiritual but not strictly religious, as I appreciate the customs of my family's Buddhist upbringing while carving my own path. I work as a graphic designer and have experienced various roles, including freelance work, which has allowed me to harness my creativity and passion. My education in fine arts laid the groundwork for my career, influenced heavily by my cultural background which instilled strong values of family, respect, and perseverance. Politically, I advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and environmental sustainability, often leaning towards progressive views. Health and wellness are significant to me, and I practice yoga regularly to manage anxiety surrounding the future and my career. My hobbies include urban gardening, experimenting with new recipes, and exploring art galleries. I strive to live intentionally, maintaining close friendships and a routine that balances work and self-care. Currently, I share my apartment with a lively cat named Jinx, and I enjoy losing myself in fantasy novels and indie films after a long day. Though I've mostly traveled around the U.S. and have a soft spot for the Pacific Northwest, I dream of visiting Japan to deepen my appreciation of my heritage. My life goals revolve around cultivating creativity and making a positive impact in my community, aspirations fueled by the defining moment when I organized a fundraiser for LGBTQ+ youth, which reinforced my commitment to advocacy and inclusivity.\" You are a buyer, talking to a seller and looking to purchase a new car.
