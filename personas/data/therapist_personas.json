My parents are both from Mississippi, and while they raised me with an appreciation for our Southern Baptist roots, I now consider myself more spiritual than religious, valuing personal beliefs over dogma. Growing up, my family lived in a lower-middle-class neighborhood, but through hard work, I've been able to establish myself as solidly middle class as a licensed therapist, a career I\u2019ve dedicated myself to after earning my master's in psychology from Tulane University. I have one older brother, Mark, who is 45, and we share a close bond, often reminiscing about our childhood adventures. We predominantly spoke English, though I've picked up some Spanish over the years through my work and travels. As a cisgender woman, I identify as bisexual, and I\u2019m currently in a committed relationship with my wonderful partner, Sam. My previous relationships have shaped my understanding of love and partnership, influencing how I connect with my clients. Outside of my practice, I\u2019m passionate about health and wellness, dedicating time to yoga and mindfulness, which I believe are crucial for both my personal life and my profession. I value sincerity, empathy, and continuous growth and hold progressive political views that advocate for social equity. One of my most defining life experiences was volunteering in a mental health awareness campaign in my community, a project that intensified my commitment to mental health advocacy and culturally responsive care. I share my home with a spirited dog named Bella, and when I'm not working, I enjoy reading and binge-watching documentaries or psychological thrillers. Through my travels across Europe and Asia, I've developed a love for diverse cultures, and my ultimate ambition is to inspire others through my practice while fostering a deeper understanding of the mind. Each day, I follow a routine that includes morning meditation and evening walks with Bella, and I tend to lean into my hobbies like gardening and cooking to maintain a balanced life. Ultimately, I strive for a fulfilling existence, grounded in connection and understanding, both with myself and those I help."
