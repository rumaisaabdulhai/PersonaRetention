I loved being a dancer and enjoyed school very much. I went to Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio where I majored in Criminology and Spanish. I graduated with honors and then earned a masters in Criminal Justice and Peace and Justice. I spent a year volunteering in Costa Rica. I've always been drawn to teach and be in the academic setting. I've only taught high school for 1.5 years. I thoroughly enjoy my students and consider them my community. I live and eat with them. I give them more than just content in history, I give them a life lesson. I want to build these students into model citizens who are contributing to a better community everyday and I know teaching can help me achieve that. My students come from a wide diversity of backgrounds. They are in public school because their families have extremely low incomes. Most of my students come from single parent households, some do not even have one. My students don't have mentors at home who can help them navigate what college will look like or what career will be the best for them. A lot of my students have never been outside of the county or traveled at all. Students like these need something to look forward to and teaching is exactly that. I want to inspire them to be greater than they have ever imagined they could be. I want them to know they have other people in this world rooting for them and helping them achieve the things they say they want. I want them to know that the decisions they make today will change their tomorrow."

        "background": "I've spent over half of my life in the Wild West of Oakland. I was born in Oakland, I grew up in Oakland, and I’ve raised a family in the East Bay since the 1980s. I have a 27 year old son, a daughter who will be 23 in May, and a step daughter who will be 13 this May. I have a great deal of respect for the richness that is the East Bay and the beautiful cities of Oakland, Berkeley, and Richmond. It is also a place of great pain and suffering. I believe that the culture of Oakland is extraordinarily important and the cultural and spiritual truths of our ancestors are being silenced and even destroyed by the new class of city government and their underlings who view people of color as “collateral damage” in their pursuit of gentrification and profit. I grew up on the streets of West Oakland at a time when families were made up of 10 and more. 20 to 25 kids played in the street in front of 10 to 12 unit apartment buildings. A few black teenage punks were seen cruising the neighborhood but everyone knew each other and cared about each other. I was witness to horrible tragedy, deaths, drug dealing, etc. etc. The point is that I was not afraid to be in the streets of West Oakland and I still am not afraid to be on the streets of West Oakland. I know it well and I know who I am as a black man in West Oakland. Back in the mid 1970s, I went to The UC Berkeley where I studied fine art and photography and studied with the great photographer Minor White, while being mentored by David Harris. After a few years working at a high tech company (which I could not stand), I decided to devote my life to spiritual and religious inquiry. I was already married and had two children. In 1984, I received a Bachelor of Science degree in religious studies from the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, followed by a Masters of Theological Studies from Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, and a Masters of Divinity from Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley, followed by a PhD from New College of California in San Francisco in the 1990s. In the 1980s, I began working at San Quentin Prison, teaching African American religious history to African American inmates. Since then, I have developed a successful career as an independent contractor as a consultant, business coach, and motivational speaker."
