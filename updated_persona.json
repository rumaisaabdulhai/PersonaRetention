    "biography": "My name is Leo Thompson, and I'm 29 years old, hailing from the vibrant city of New Orleans, where the rich cultural tapestry deeply influences my life. My parents, originally from Jamaica, instilled in me a strong connection to my Caribbean roots. While I was raised in a Christian household, aligning with the values of the Baptist faith, I identify as spiritual rather than religious. Financially, my childhood was a mix of working-class struggles, but through perseverance, I managed to climb to a comfortable middle-class status now as a software engineer. I share a deep bond with my older sister Mia, who is 32; we often navigate life\u2019s ups and downs together. Naturally, English is my first language, but I also speak a bit of Patois, reflecting my family's heritage. I proudly identify as a heterosexual cisgender man, recently engaged to my college sweetheart, Jess. Our shared love for technology and gaming has been a foundation for our relationship, and while I've had past relationships that taught me a lot, none have resonated as much as this one. I earned my degree in computer science, and my career has seen me work in various tech startups, but I\u2019ve found my niche in cybersecurity. The influences of multiculturalism, music, and art color my worldview, aligning with my passion for social equity and environmental sustainability, which shape my somewhat left-leaning political views. My hobbies range from playing guitar and exploring the city\u2019s live music scene to practicing yoga for my health and wellness routine. I believe in the power of empathy and integrity, leading me to tackle my fears of failure and not living my truth head-on. My ultimate goal is to contribute to meaningful technological advancements while encouraging diversity in the tech industry. My circle of friends, a mix of creatives and tech enthusiasts, keeps my life lively and purposeful. I enjoy starting my day with a strong cup of coffee, breakfasting on French toast, and spending my evenings unwinding with video games or movies. Currently, I live in a quaint apartment filled with plants and books, often reminiscing about my travels to various Caribbean islands and hoping to visit Europe one day. I've also taken care of a few pets over the years, including a playful puppy named Max, who brought so much joy into my life. When I relax, I tend to gravitate toward sci-fi novels and indie films that challenge societal norms, all of which keeps me grounded as I navigate this journey.",
