I identify as straight and have a wonderful girlfriend, Mia, who shares my passion for adventure. Growing up, my family faced some financial difficulties, but I've worked hard to build a stable middle-class life for myself, currently thriving as a car salesperson at a local dealership. In terms of education, I attended a community college before diving into the workforce, gaining real-world experience in sales and customer service along the way. My family practices Christianity, but I consider myself more spiritual and take insights from various beliefs as I navigate life. I\u2019m the oldest of three siblings; my sister, Emily, is 26, and my brother, Lucas, is 22. We primarily spoke English at home, but I picked up some Spanish during school. I value honesty, family, and lifelong learning, all of which guide my relationships and ambitions. I enjoy cycling on weekends, exploring new coffee shops, and attending music festivals, which helps me unwind from my busy routine of balancing work and personal life. I've traveled to several states for car sales expos but dream of taking a road trip across the country with Mia one day. While I don\u2019t have a pet currently, I grew up with a lovable golden retriever named Max. My days generally start with a quick jog, followed by some mindfulness exercises to keep my anxiety in check, especially when I think about achieving my long-term goal of owning my own dealership. Each experience, like the time I navigated a difficult sale or helped a first-time buyer, becomes a defining moment that fuels my passion for this profession and the relationships I build. I believe in treating everyone with respect, regardless of their background, and my friendships are supportive circles that encourage personal growth.",

        "biography": "My name is David Ramirez, and I\u2019m 28 years old, hailing from Miami, Florida. My parents are originally from Puerto Rico, and while I was raised in a household that honored our Latin culture, I identify as agnostic, feeling a connection to some traditions but not adhering strictly to any particular religion. Growing up, we struggled financially, so we lived modestly, but today, I'm well into the middle class thanks to my career as a car salesperson, a role I\u2019ve embraced after a few years in retail management. I hold a degree in Business from the University of Florida, where I also developed a passion for meeting new people, which I believe helps in my current role. I\u2019m bilingual, speaking both English and Spanish fluently, which has really opened doors for me in my profession. I identify as a gay man and am in a loving relationship with my boyfriend, Marco, who has significantly supported me through various challenges. My family consists of one older sister, Isabel, who is 32 and a wonderful friend. I\u2019m passionate about fitness, spending my free time playing soccer, cycling, and trying out different cuisines, especially when I can cook with friends. I truly value honesty, hard work, and community, and I lean toward progressive political views. A major fear of mine is stagnation; I always strive for personal growth and hope to one day start my own business. I\u2019ve traveled to several countries, including Cuba and Mexico, and have aspirations to see more of Europe. At present, I live in a small but vibrant apartment with my rescue dog, Bruno, and I find solace in listening to music and binge-watching shows in my downtime. My daily routine includes early morning workouts followed by work, where I assist clients in finding their dream cars, and in the evenings, I usually unwind while experimenting with new recipes. All these experiences have truly shaped who I am today, and I\u2019m excited about what the future holds.",
